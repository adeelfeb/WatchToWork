The email from GitHub about your "codespace limit being exceeded" might be due to GitHub Codespaces usage, which is separate from what you're doing on Stackblitz.

Here's an overview of why this could be happening:

### 1. **GitHub Codespaces Usage**
   - **GitHub Codespaces** is a cloud-based development environment provided by GitHub that runs on virtual machines. When you create a codespace, you're allocated resources like CPU, memory, and storage, which can be limited depending on your account type (free or paid).
   - If you have created a codespace (even unintentionally or by a script), or if you're using GitHub Codespaces for other projects, this could explain the email about exceeding the limit.

### 2. **Stackblitz vs. GitHub Codespaces**
   - **Stackblitz** and **GitHub Codespaces** are independent services. You’re using Stackblitz for development and committing code to GitHub, but that doesn’t mean you’re using GitHub Codespaces directly.
   - If you're not actively using Codespaces, but it's still enabled for your repository or account, background operations (like automated environments) might be consuming resources.

### 3. **Why This Could Happen**
   - **Previous Codespaces**: Even if you're not currently using GitHub Codespaces, you might have created a codespace earlier that’s still running in the background, consuming resources.
   - **Linked Actions**: If your GitHub repository has workflows or continuous integration (CI) that uses GitHub Codespaces (such as for building or testing code), it might be using up your available quota.
   - **Configuration**: Certain GitHub workflows might be configured to spin up Codespaces or run CI jobs that are contributing to this usage.

### What to Do:
1. **Check Your Active Codespaces**: 
   - Go to your GitHub account, and under **Codespaces** (https://github.com/codespaces), check if there are any active codespaces. You can delete any unused ones to free up resources.
   
2. **Manage Billing and Quota**:
   - If you have a limited GitHub plan, you may want to review your plan's limits for Codespaces usage. If you're frequently hitting your quota, consider upgrading your plan or adjusting your workflow to minimize Codespaces usage.

3. **Disable Codespaces**:
   - If you’re not using GitHub Codespaces and don't want it to consume your resources, you can disable it in your repository or account settings.

4. **Check GitHub Actions**:
   - Review your repository's GitHub Actions settings. If your workflow includes launching Codespaces or any resource-heavy jobs, this might be using your Codespaces quota.
