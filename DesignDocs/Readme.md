# Design Documentation for **WatchToWork**

Welcome to the design documentation folder for the **WatchToWork** project, a YouTube video learning assistant tool designed to generate and evaluate transcripts, summaries, MCQs, and short questions from a given YouTube video link.

## üìÅ Folder Overview

This folder contains all design-related documentation for the **WatchToWork** project. It includes system architecture, interface design, algorithmic workflows, and other essential design components that guide the development process.

## üìú Documents Included

### 1. **System Architecture Diagram**
   - **Filename**: `system-architecture.md`
   - This document contains the architectural blueprint of the **WatchToWork** platform. It includes details on how different modules (YouTube API, transcript generation, MCQ generation, etc.) interact with each other.
   - **Contents**:
     - Frontend and Backend flow
     - Integration with YouTube API
     - Data handling pipeline
     - MCQ and question-answer generation logic

### 2. **User Interface Design**
   - **Filename**: `ui-design.md`
   - Outlines the key aspects of the website's user interface (UI), including:
     - Homepage where the user inputs a YouTube video link.
     - The section where users receive summaries, MCQs, and questions.
     - Evaluation interface for user feedback.
   - Includes wireframes, mockups, and style guide.

### 3. **API Workflow and Design**
   - **Filename**: `api-design.md`
   - Describes how API requests and responses will be handled, with a focus on the integration with external services like the YouTube API, transcript services, and ML models.
   - **Key Sections**:
     - API routes for handling video input and summarization
     - Error handling and response codes
     - Standardization of requests from the frontend

### 4. **Prompt Engineering and Question Generation**
   - **Filename**: `prompt-engineering.md`
   - Details the techniques used for prompt engineering and question generation. This is essential for generating accurate and meaningful MCQs and short-answer questions from the video transcript.
   - **Contents**:
     - Types of prompts used
     - Optimizing prompts for specific content types (e.g., lectures, interviews)
     - Sample questions generated

### 5. **Evaluation Logic and Algorithm**
   - **Filename**: `evaluation-algorithm.md`
   - Explains how the user's answers to the MCQs and short questions will be evaluated.
   - **Contents**:
     - Techniques for comparing user answers with correct answers.
     - Logic used for MCQ evaluation and feedback generation.

### 6. **Color Palette and Typography**
   - **Filename**: `design-styles.md`
   - Documents the design choices for the frontend, focusing on the minimalist and AI-driven interface, including:
     - Color palette inspired by YouTube and AI-related themes.
     - Typography (Roboto font family).
     - Design elements such as button styles, hover effects, and forms.

## üîç How to Use This Documentation

- Each document serves as a guide for understanding the design choices and workflows in **WatchToWork**.
- Refer to the **System Architecture Diagram** first for a high-level overview.
- For implementation details of specific components, see the respective files (e.g., UI, API, prompt engineering).
