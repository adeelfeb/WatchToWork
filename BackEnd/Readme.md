Here’s a briefing on how you created your project using GitHub Codespaces and Stackblitz:

### 1. **Project Setup in GitHub Codespaces**
   - **Initiating the Project:**
     You started by creating a project repository on **GitHub** and opened it in **GitHub Codespaces**. Codespaces provided you with a cloud-based development environment where you can write and test your code without needing to install anything on your local machine.
   
   - **Linking with Stackblitz:**
     You then linked your GitHub repository with **Stackblitz**, which allows you to run and preview the project in a browser environment. Stackblitz provides a real-time view of your project, making it easy to see changes live.

### 2. **Installing Node.js Environment**
   - **Setting Up Node.js:**
     You ensured that the **Node.js** environment was correctly installed in Stackblitz, which is necessary to run JavaScript-based projects, such as Express.js applications. Stackblitz automatically sets up the environment, and you likely installed Node.js dependencies using the terminal.
   
   - **Initializing NPM:**
     After that, you initialized the project with **npm** by running the command:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```
     This generated a `package.json` file, which manages the project’s metadata and dependencies.

### 3. **Installing Dependencies**
   - **Package Installation:**
     You installed the required package dependencies. In this case, you installed **Express**, a lightweight web framework for Node.js, by running:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```
     This added Express to the project, and the dependency was listed in the `package.json` file.

### 4. **Setting the Starting Point**
   - **Defining the Entry Point:**
     In the `package.json` file, you defined the **starting point** of your application by specifying `"index.js"` as the main entry point. This tells Node.js where to start when the application is run.

### 5. **Basic Express Setup**
   - **Creating the Express Server:**
     Inside `index.js`, you wrote the basic Express server setup:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     const app = express();

     app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello World!');
     });

     const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
     app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
     });
     ```
     - This code sets up a web server that listens on **port 3000** and responds with "Hello World!" when the root route (`/`) is accessed.
   
### 6. **Running the Project**
   - After writing the Express code, you ran the project in **Stackblitz**, which allows you to preview the web server’s output (e.g., `Hello World`) in the browser.
   
Now you’ve successfully set up an **Express.js** project, running in a cloud environment linked between **GitHub Codespaces** and **Stackblitz**. You can easily manage and collaborate on the project while keeping it stored on GitHub.
